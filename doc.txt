The app will have two modes:
- evaluate
- compare

In evaluate mode you can input either dice with standard dice notation, or input a spell name (and optionally level) and get its statistics.
Statistics will include:
- Evaluation ID (useful for compare)
- Original roll / spell request
- Average outcome of the roll
- Minimum and Maximum of the roll
- Chance to beat a target number? might be actually hard to do with really complex rolls, I'll have to think about it

In "compare" you can give up to two Evaluation IDs and see previous evaluations / compare their results


Requirements:
- using variables (I think this comes in any way)
- using conditional statements (This will at minimum be in the mode swap)
- using collections and loops (The app itself will be a big loop, but also will be in for example complex roll reading)
	- lists, dictionaries (list, sure, easy. directory, I'll look for a place, although I plan to use a class for the evaluation results)
- creating your own functions (will do, I like to split my code into utility functions)
- using JSON data (either file or internet API) (the api request will have me handling JSON)
